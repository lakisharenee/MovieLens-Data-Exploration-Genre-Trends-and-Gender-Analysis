# MovieLensDataAnalysis
The simple goal for this repository is to demonstrate exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques using Python.  
I ran queries on the dataset to answer the following questions and more:
  How many movies are there in each genre/category?
  Which movies fall into more than one genre/category?
  What are the trends across genres where gender is concerned?
I created queries to answer these questions and also draw inferences from the data.
