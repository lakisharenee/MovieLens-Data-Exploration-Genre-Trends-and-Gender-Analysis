# MovieLensDataAnalysis
Using the MovieLens dataset, the goal for this repository is to demonstrate visualization and exploratory data analysis using Python.  
I ran queries on the dataset to answer the following questions and more:
  How many movies are there in each genre/category?
  Which movies fall into more than one genre/category?
  What are the trends across genres where gender is concerned?

Packages imported:  Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas & Numpy
